When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    I would use a remote repo instead of local when I can directly edit my new commits and I don't require to work upon the files for
    making commits. Also, if we don't need some changes for us, but want to make them available for others, then we can directly use a
    public remote repo.
